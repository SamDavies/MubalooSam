# Sam's Implementation of the Mubaloo Test

I've used a Redux architecture instead of MCV, this gives a unidirectional data flow and a centralized datastore so that the application in more maintainable and extendable.

/MubalooSam
    /yourapplication.py

        /style.css
    /templates
        layout.html
        index.html
        login.html
